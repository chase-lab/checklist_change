Recent (or current) composition was assessed through net sampling of reservoirs several times between 2002 and 2007. Historical (or original) composition was reconstructed by the authors by including all native species contacted in the years 2000s and excluding all exotic species.
METHODS: 'Twenty reservoirs were sampled, which are located in three major freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al., 2008) in southern Brazil: Southeastern Mata Atlantica, Iguassu, and Upper Parana freshwater ecoregions[...]Fish sampling at each reservoir involved the deployment of gillnets (mesh size: 2.4 to 16 cm between opposite knots) and trammel nets (inner mesh size: 6 to 8 cm) with a length of 10 to 20 m and height of 1.5 to 4.5 m. In most of the reservoirs, the set of gillnets were deployed in three sampling sites arranged along the reservoirs[...]The gillnets were located at the surface, bottom, and margin of each sampling site and were in the water for 24 h. In addition, in the littoral areas of the reservoirs, fish were captured with a 20-m-long seine net (0.5 cm mesh size), during the day and night periods.[...]Datasets were constructed according to expert opinions and the fish sampling (species occurrence data) from all reservoirs for each time period: initial period represented the most probable â€˜originalâ€™ pool of native species, and contained all native species that were recorded at least once during the 2002 to 2007 time period (i.e., species composition prior to native extirpations and nonnative introductions), and the current period that represented all native and nonnative species recorded during 2002/2003, 2004/2005, and 2006/2007.'
