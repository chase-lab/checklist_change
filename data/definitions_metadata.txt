variable name	definition
dataset_id	"Unique ID linked to a publication (article or data set). If the data set was split because different taxa group are provided, a letter is added at the end."
year	"Year of sampling. If sampling was pooled over several years, the last sampling year is used here."
regional	"Region name, countains at least two localities. Can be a national park, a state or a forest name for example but smaller scales are also included where the region is an experimental sites. A data set can have several regions."
local	"Name or code of the sampled locality or experimental sample. For example, it can correspond to the name of an island, a lake or forest."
latitude	"Latitude North in decimal degree, WGS84"
longitude	"Longitude East in decimal degree, WGS84"
effort	"Either the number of visits to a plot, the total area sampled in a given year, etc. See Comment column for a description."
data_pooled_by_authors	TRUE if the data provided by the authors was already pooled covering several years: several samples made over several years pooled together.
data_pooled_by_authors_comment	"If there was pooling by the original authors, countains free text describing how the authors pooled their data."
sampling_years	"If there was pooling by the original authors, countains the years sampled for each period. ""1997, 1999"" means 1997 and 1999, ""1997-1999"" means 1997, 1998 and 1999."
alpha_grain_m2	Area of the local unit or area of the sampling gear (alpha_grain_type = sample).
alpha_grain_type	"Category of alpha_grain, one of: ""island"", ""plot"", ""administrative"", ""watershed"", ""sample"", ""lake_pond"", ""archipelago"", ""trap"", ""transect"", ""ecosystem"", ""functional"", ""box"" or ""quadrat""."
alpha_grain_comment	Description of the alpha_grain measure
gamma_bounding_box_km2	"Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the area covering all sites, computed as a convex-hull or a rectangle box or as the area of the administrative unit in which sites are found."
gamma_bounding_box_type	"Category of gamma_bounding_box, one of: ""administrative"", ""island"", ""functional"", ""convex-hull"", ""watershed"", ""box"", ""buffer"", ""ecosystem"", ""shore"" or ""lake_pond""."
gamma_bounding_box_comment	Description or source of the gamma_bounding_box value
gamma_sum_grains_km2	Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the sum of the grains sampled each year.
gamma_sum_grains_type	"Category of gamma_sum_grains, one of: ""archipelago"", ""administrative"", ""watershed"", ""sample"", ""lake_pond"", ""plot"", ""quadrat"", ""transect"", ""ecosystem"", ""functional"" or ""box"""
gamma_sum_grains_comment	Description or source of the gamma_sum_grains value
realm	"Realm in which the sampling was done, one of: Freshwater or Terrestrial"
taxon	"Taxon group of the data set, one of: ""Plants"", ""Invertebrates"" or ""Fish"" "
comment	"A description of the data set origin, goal and sampling method."
comment_standardisation	"A short description of the modifications we made to the data set to ensure standard effort: excluded sites or years, excluded taxa, etc"
