variable name	definition
dataset_id	"Unique ID linked to a publication (article or data set). If the data set was split because different taxa group are provided, a letter is added at the end. No missing value."
year	"Year of sampling. If sampling was pooled over several years, the last sampling year is used here. No missing value."
regional	"Region name, countains at least two localities. Can be a national park, a state or a forest name for example but smaller scales are also included where the region is an experimental sites. A data set can have several regions. No missing value. UTF-8 encoding."
local	"Name or code of the sampled locality or experimental sample. For example, it can correspond to the name of an island, a lake or forest. No missing value. UTF-8 encoding."
latitude	"Latitude North in decimal degree, WGS84. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
longitude	"Longitude East in decimal degree, WGS84. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
effort	"Either the number of visits to a plot, the total area sampled in a given year, etc. See Comment column for a description. No missing value."
data_pooled_by_authors	TRUE if the data provided by the authors was already pooled covering several years: several samples made over several years pooled together. No missing value.
data_pooled_by_authors_comment	"If there was pooling by the original authors, countains free text describing how the authors pooled their data. Empty cells when no pooling was done."
sampling_years	"If there was pooling by the original authors, countains the years sampled for each period. ""1997, 1999"" means 1997 and 1999, ""1997-1999"" means 1997, 1998 and 1999. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
alpha_grain_m2	Area of the local unit or area of the sampling gear (alpha_grain_type = sample). Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected.
alpha_grain_type	"Category of alpha_grain, one of: ""island"", ""plot"", ""administrative"", ""watershed"", ""sample"", ""lake_pond"", ""archipelago"", ""trap"", ""transect"", ""ecosystem"", ""functional"", ""box"" or ""quadrat"". No missing value."
alpha_grain_comment	Description of the alpha_grain measure. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected.
gamma_bounding_box_km2	"Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the area covering all sites, computed as a convex-hull or a rectangle box or as the area of the administrative unit in which sites are found. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_bounding_box_type	"Category of gamma_bounding_box, one of: ""administrative"", ""island"", ""functional"", ""convex-hull"", ""watershed"", ""box"", ""buffer"", ""ecosystem"", ""shore"" or ""lake_pond"". Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_bounding_box_comment	Description or source of the gamma_bounding_box value. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected.
gamma_sum_grains_km2	Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the sum of the grains sampled each year. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected.
gamma_sum_grains_type	"Category of gamma_sum_grains, one of: ""archipelago"", ""administrative"", ""watershed"", ""sample"", ""lake_pond"", ""plot"", ""quadrat"", ""transect"", ""ecosystem"", ""functional"" or ""box"". Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_sum_grains_comment	Description or source of the gamma_sum_grains value. Empty cells indicate that information could not be collected.
realm	"Realm in which the sampling was done, one of: Freshwater or Terrestrial. No missing value."
taxon	"Taxon group of the data set, one of: ""Plants"", ""Invertebrates"" or ""Fish"". No missing value."
comment	"A description of the data set origin, goal and sampling method. No missing value. UTF-8 encoding."
comment_standardisation	"A short description of the modifications we made to the data set to ensure standard effort: excluded sites or years, excluded taxa, etc. No missing value."
doi   "One or several DOIs separated by ""|""" that have to be cited for each data set."
is_coordinate_local_scale	Logical. TRUE if coordinates re given at the scale of the site/locality. FALSE if the coordinates are at the regional scale or missing. No missing value.
