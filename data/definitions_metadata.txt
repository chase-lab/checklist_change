variable name	definition
dataset_id	"Unique ID linked to a publication (article or data set). If the data set was split because different taxa group are provided, a letter is added at the end. No missing value."
year	"Year of sampling. If sampling was pooled over several years, the last sampling year is used here. Where year (i.e., date) for historical lists was not available, they were estimated based on human visitation/colonisation history. No missing value."
regional	"Region name, contains at least two localities. Can be a national park, a state or a forest name for example but smaller scales are also included where the region is an experimental sites. A data set can have several regions. No missing value."
local	"Name or code of the sampled locality or experimental sample as given by the original data provider. For example, it can correspond to the name of an island, a lake or forest. No missing value."
latitude	"Latitude North in decimal degree, WGS84. NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
longitude	"Longitude East in decimal degree, WGS84. NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
effort	"Sampling effort expressed for example as the number of visits to a plot or the total area sampled in a given year. See Comment column for a description. NA value means that exact effort is unknown but considered extensive and exhaustive."
data_pooled_by_authors	TRUE if the data provided by the authors was already pooled covering several years: several samples made over several years pooled together. No missing value.
data_pooled_by_authors_comment	"If there was pooling by the original authors, countains free text describing how the authors pooled their data. NA values when no pooling was done."
sampling_years	"If there was pooling by the original authors, contains the years sampled for each period. ""1997, 1999"" means 1997 and 1999, ""1997-1999"" means 1997, 1998 and 1999. NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
alpha_grain_m2	Area of the local unit or area of the sampling gear (in which case, alpha_grain_type = sample). NA values indicate that information could not be collected.
alpha_grain_type	"Category of alpha_grain specifying what does the alpha_grain measure relate to. Allowed values are: ""island"", ""plot"", ""administrative"" (eg the area of a park or state), ""watershed"", ""sample"", ""lake_pond"", ""archipelago"", ""trap"", ""transect"", ""ecosystem"" (eg the area of the whole wetland or generally the area of adjacent comparable habitat), ""box"" (a box covering the sites) or ""quadrat"". No missing value."
alpha_grain_comment	Description of how the alpha_grain was measured. NA values indicate that information could not be collected.
gamma_bounding_box_km2	"Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the area covering all sites, computed as a convex-hull or a rectangle box or as the area of the administrative unit in which sites are found. NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_bounding_box_type	"Category of gamma_bounding_box specifying what does the gamma_bounding_box relate to. Generally the bounding box is computed based on coordinates of the sites of by using a coarse area such as the area of the park, the state or the whole island. Allowed values are: ""administrative"" (eg the area of a park or state), ""island"", ""convex-hull"", ""watershed"", ""box"" (a box covering the sites), ""buffer"", ""functional"" (eg the area of the whole wetland or generally the area of adjacent comparable habitat), ""shore"" or ""lake_pond"". NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_bounding_box_comment	Description or source (eg the paper, Wikipedia or measured on Google Earth) of the gamma_bounding_box value. NA values indicate that information could not be collected.
gamma_sum_grains_km2	Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the sum of the grains sampled each year. NA values indicate that information could not be collected.
gamma_sum_grains_type	"Category of gamma_sum_grains specifying what does the gamma_sum_grains relate to. Generally the type is related to the type of the alpha_grain since it is a sum of all alpha_grains in a region in a given year. Allowed values are: ""archipelago"", ""administrative"" (eg the area of a park or state), ""watershed"", ""sample"", ""lake_pond"", ""plot"", ""quadrat"", ""transect"", ""functional"" (eg the area of the whole wetland or generally the area of adjacent comparable habitat) or ""box"" (a box covering the sites). NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_sum_grains_comment	Description or source (eg the paper, Wikipedia or measured on Google Earth) of the gamma_sum_grains value. NA values indicate that information could not be collected.
realm	"Realm in which the sampling was done, one of: Freshwater or Terrestrial. No missing value."
taxon	"Taxon group of the data set, one of: ""Plants"", ""Invertebrates"" or ""Fish"". No missing value."
comment	"A description of the data set origin, goal and sampling method. No missing value."
comment_standardisation	"A short description of the modifications we made to the data set to ensure standard effort: excluded sites or years, excluded taxa, etc. No missing value."
doi   "One or several DOIs separated by ""|""" that have to be cited for each data set."
is_coordinate_local_scale	Logical. TRUE if coordinates re given at the scale of the site/locality. FALSE if the coordinates are at the regional scale or missing. No missing value.
