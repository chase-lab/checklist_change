variable name	necessary	definition
dataset_id	TRUE	Unique ID linked to a publication (article or data set). If the data set was split because different taxa group are provided, a letter is added at the end.
year	TRUE	Year of sampling. If sampling was pooled over several years, the last sampling year is used here.
regional	TRUE	Region name, countains at least two localities. Can be a national park, a state or a forest name for example but smaller scales are also included where the region is an experimental sites. A data set can have several regions.
local	TRUE	Name or code of the sampled locality or experimental sample. For example, it can correspond to the name of an island, a lake or forest.
latitude	TRUE	Latitude North in decimal degree, WGS84
longitude	TRUE	Longitude East in decimal degree, WGS84
effort	TRUE	NA
data_pooled_by_authors	TRUE	TRUE if the data provided by the authors was already pooled covering several years: several samples made over several years pooled together.
data_pooled_by_authors_comment	FALSE	If there was pooling by the original authors, countains free text describing how the authors pooled their data.
sampling_years	FALSE	If there was pooling by the original authors, countains the years sampled for each period. "1997, 1999" means 1997 and 1999, "1997-1999" means 1997, 1998 and 1999.
alpha_grain	TRUE	Temporary column. Area of the local unit or area of the sampling gear (alpha_grain_type = sample).  This column is entirely converted to m2 in alpha_grain_m2.
alpha_grain_unit	TRUE	Temporary column. Unit of the area recorded in alpha_grain
alpha_grain_type	TRUE	Category of alpha_grain, one of: "island", "plot", "administrative", "watershed", "sample", "lake_pond", "archipelago", "trap", "transect", "ecosystem", "functional", "box" or "quadrat".
alpha_grain_comment	TRUE	Description of the alpha_grain measure
gamma_bounding_box	TRUE	Temporary column. Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the area covering all sites, computed as a convex-hull or a rectangle box or as the area of the administrative unit in which sites are found. This column is entirely converted to km2 in gamma_bounding_box_km2.
gamma_bounding_box_unit	TRUE	Temporary column. Unit in which the gamma_bounding_box area is expressed
gamma_bounding_box_type	TRUE	Category of gamma_bounding_box, one of: "administrative", "island", "functional", "convex-hull", "watershed", "box", "buffer", "ecosystem", "shore" or "lake_pond".
gamma_bounding_box_comment	TRUE	Description or source of the gamma_bounding_box value
gamma_sum_grains	TRUE	Temporary column. Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the sum of the grains sampled each year. This column is entirely converted to km2 in gamma_sum_grains_km2.
gamma_sum_grains_unit	TRUE	Temporary column. Unit in which the gamma_sum_grains area is expressed
gamma_sum_grains_type	TRUE	Category of gamma_sum_grains, one of: "archipelago", "administrative", "watershed", "sample", "lake_pond", "plot", "quadrat", "transect", "ecosystem", "functional" or "box"
gamma_sum_grains_comment	TRUE	Description or source of the gamma_sum_grains value
realm	TRUE	Realm in which the sampling was done, one of: Freshwater or Terrestrial
taxon	TRUE	Taxon group of the data set, one of: "Plants", "Invertebrates" or "Fish" 
comment	TRUE	A description of the data set origin, goal and sampling method.
comment_standardisation	TRUE	A short description of the modifications we made to the data set to ensure standard effort: excluded sites or years, excluded taxa, etc
