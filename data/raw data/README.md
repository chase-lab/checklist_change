## Raw data
Each folder corresponds to a data set, i.e. data from an article or a research project.  

Either online data were directly saved in these folders or they were saved in `./data/cache/` pre-processed and then saved in `./data/raw data/`.
The folders in `./data/raw data/` contain all files needed to run the wrangling script corresponding to each data set.
